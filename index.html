        <p>Hello! My name is Jean Robert Nakilu Tshangu
         and I am from Kinshasa the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I am exited to be part of this adventure
         this semester with you here</p>
         <p>
            I have already taken this course before and HTML and CSS are not really 
            brand new to me, but as I was taking this course, I was not able to finish
            it due to some circumstances and now I am really determined and I will
            try my best to reach the end of the course by doing everything in advance.
